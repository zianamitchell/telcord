# TelCord Repository

This is my collection of telegram to discord Integromat of blueprints


# About TelCord
TelCord is a automated system that sends message sent or forwarded (depending on the blueprint you selected) to my telegram bot to a specified discord channel on a specified discord server set up by you, the user, via Integromat. 


# Installation

Import to Integromat (once done should be located in your scenarios section)


# Customization

Once uploaded to Integromat the only modules that should need to be customized are the discord modules.

You need to either select an existing discord connection or create a new one. Do this for all discord modules. Both discord modules should be connected to the same discord channel/server.

For further customization instructions please read the READMEs included with each blueprint.
